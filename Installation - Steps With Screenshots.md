# Install CSL Styles
You can just download the files at this repository main page and then follow the normal procedure (install style from a local file in Zotero preferences menu)


1.Start with the centered highlight template in its thighest form - let the two other templates and the csl style import for another moment. No need to edit the name, nor the other two template, neither the csl style for the moment.
2.Just follow your usual routine of reading and note taking.


4.Open a word editor and open the add note option. Retrieve the note you just created - it should the first on the list as results are filter by date of modification.
For that you'll need to install the Zotero pluggin for (compatible) word editors i.e. LibreOffice for example.

Ready!
Now you could add and edit your bibliography as usual, and format the document at your convenience.
