# 1. Install Formated Templates
As html scripts, there is no formal installation in the conventional sense of software installation per se.<br />
Activating the choral templates is made by text edition and basic copy-pasting.<br />
<p> 1) From Zoter desktop interface : Edition -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Configuration editor.<br />
2) write "template" in the main search bar<br />
3) either double-click or right click to the three template fields. They all start with "extensions.zotero.annotations.noteTemplates."<br />
4)Edit the each three item fields with templates names that correspond to its suffix: "title"; "note"; and "highlight" and click OK or press enter.<br />

<i>Small tip: </i> Do not close the preference pane so you could switch back to it and re-edit the template for your personal adjustments.</p>

See the following picture that recaps all the template editing part (Centered-formatted template in this example):

For other templates just repeat the steps [mutatis mutandis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutatis_mutandis).
