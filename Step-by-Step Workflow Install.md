# 1. "Install" Formated Templates
As html scripts, there is no formal installation in the conventional sense of software installation per se.<br />
Activating the choral templates is made by text edition and basic copy-pasting.<br />
<p> 1) From Zoter desktop interface : Edition -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Configuration editor.<br />
2) write "template" in the main search bar<br />
3) either double-click or right click to the three template fields. They all start with "extensions.zotero.annotations.noteTemplates."<br />
4)Edit the each three item fields with templates names that correspond to its suffix: "title"; "note"; and "highlight" and click OK or press enter.<br />

<i>Small tip: </i> Do not close the preference pane so you could switch back to it and re-edit the template for your personal adjustments.</p>

See the following picture that recaps all the template editing part (Centered-formatted template in this example):

For other templates just repeat the steps [mutatis mutandis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutatis_mutandis).

# 2. Install CSL Styles in Zotero
* In some simple case, with for example only one author, you could use any style you want and then search for "(author%date%)", or whatever syntax related to the CSL Style you have chosen, and replace by "Author", or any term you like. However, for more complexe citations and compilation with more than one note, it will get nastier and the CSL Style should help.
* You can download the files directly from the main page of this repository
* Then [follow the normal procedure to install a style from a local file in Zotero preferences menu](https://www.zotero.org/support/styles).
* You can also edit your own CSL style (follow the guideline from the same link mentionned above).<br />
Adding a style should looks like this from Zotero Edition -> Preferences -> Cite: <br />

* See is also in [Zotero pages](https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-6/) if in doubt.

# 4. Finishing
* From your text editor (with Zotero plugin installed) add any of your note that has been formatted.<br>

</p>
