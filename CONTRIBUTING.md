Thank you for considering to contribute to the choral annotations for Zotero!<br />
Here are some ways you could contribute:<br />
* Try it! 
* Tell it to a friend, a colleague, or share it on your socialnetworks
* Improve wording and documentation
* Send bug reports
* Any feedback is very welcome!<br />
This a side project and I estimate that 10 to 15 days is an appropriate time to respond.<br />
Thanks!
