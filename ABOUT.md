# Additional Notes
* The described security concern above are the result of my own opinion and, with all that has been said in the space of this repo, the use of the templates remains at your own risk.<br />
* This my first public repository and my first public release. If you see any issue with something please send me a kind word to explain the situation. You can open an issue in this repo or write a message in Zotero forum mentioning "choral template" or @alflamingo.
* Betamigo98 and alflamingo are two aliases I use, I could have merge it but as it has consequences (minor) on previous mentioning, I am sticking to both of it. I am currently doing a Master in sociology.
* If you use the templates in this repo, for choral annotations or other used, please consider using the recommended citation in the CITATION.ff file (should be one click using Zotero connector) and, if you wish, tell me about how you found it usefull or not.
* A Public Library is linked to this repo where you will find every references made in this repo, along with with some extended bibliography and various ressources. [See Choral Annotation in Zotero Groups.](https://www.zotero.org/search/type/group?q=Choral%20Annotation)
* Choral has been chosen from other words such as polyphonia, dramatic, and dialogic. Decision had been partly due as of personal preference and partly because it can be used to discuss and illustrate the former words on a conceptual level, and not being a concept itself (or more distant to conceptual connotation to my view, [read more about this](https://github.com/betamigo98/Choral-Annotations-For-Zotero/blob/main/README.md#more-about-choral-annotations)).
* It has been framed as "a technology" so far due to a lack of better alternatives, but is a script for the most part.
* Screenshot files are quite big to be displayed in github and should be reduced. You can see it anyway, or download it.
