# Jump start
Dare to give it a quick try!
To get a first look of what you can do in a snap, here is a recomendation:

## Precautionnary steps if you are not familiar with zotero advanced preference editing
-You shall copy the default template field and put it somewhere (word document, zotero note, blocnote or notepad++ for example), but don't worry, the Zotero documentation already has everything at place if you mess up something.
-This step is actually important if you have edited the default template, as only you has written it so double check and make a copy just in case

## A Steps-by-step recommendation
1. Start with the centered highlight template in its thighest form - let the two other templates and the csl style import for another moment.
No need to edit the name, nor the other two template, neither the csl style for the moment.
2. Just follow your usual routine of reading and note taking.
3. For a better effect and surprise, export all your anntation at once - create note from annotation button in the righ-hand pane of the reader <i>(you could also try straight away with couples of annotation in the note file.</i>

Now hopefully you should have a much better idea of the end result of a proper edition.
What will remains for a propper finish is to strap out the parentesis wrapping the author-date - the csl style will do ; and decide if and where do you want to put the "" and the eventual dashes.
Of course you could also try with the left-right format. The rationale of this jump start was that the centered format is slighlty more visually striking than the other left-right format.
If you feel ready for it, check the detailed workflow section.
