# Jump start
Dare to give it a quick try!<br>

To get a first look of what you can do with the choral templates, below is the shortest path to start with.

## Safety-Check if you are not familiar editing Zotero advanced preferences
- If you are more familiar or already have edited templates before, the templates field are specific to you so don't forget to copy paste them in a text document and save it before anything.
- If you are not familiar with editing template from the advanced configutation pane, all the default templates are avalaible in the official Zotero documentation, so there is no particular reason to worry about breaking anything.
- That's pretty much all! All your previous notes and annotations will not be affected permanently. The templates takes effect only for the future annotation you will add to a note. It is entirely reversible <i>(this is good for later: you could format the same note with all your templates for comparing and making variations)</i>.
- If you feel in doubt do a proper [backup of your Zotero data](https://www.zotero.org/support/zotero_data#backing_up_your_zotero_data) before proceeding.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Start by copy the [centered highlight template](https://github.com/betamigo98/Choral-Annotations-For-Zotero/blob/main/TEMPLATES%20SCRIPTS.md#111-base-templates) in its thighest form and paste it in the templateHighlight field from avacned preference pane. Let the two other templates (title and note) and the csl style import for another moment.
2. Follow your usual routine of reading and note taking.
3. Add your annotations to a note from the right-hand pane menu (top-right button). Either one-by-one (you will have to create a note beforehand), either all at once by right-clicking in the right-hand pane and choose "create note from annotations".<br>
<i> For a better effect and surprise, export all your anntations at once - click "[create note from annotation button](https://github.com/betamigo98/PolyDevice/blob/main/Screenshots/Libre%20Office%20-%20Add%20Notes.png)" in the top-right-of the right-hand pane in the reader </i>.

    That's it!

Now hopefully you should have a much better idea of the end result of a proper edition.<br>

What will remain for a propper finish is to strap out the parentesis wrapping the author-date. The CST Style will do that from the text editor and to decide if you want to put the double brackets ```" "``` and the eventual dashes. And where to put it.<br>

## Give it a proper finish
* If you feel ready for it, check the [detailed workflow section](https://github.com/betamigo98/Choral-Annotations-For-Zotero/blob/main/Step-by-Step%20Workflow%20Install.md) to finish editing your chorale annotations in your text editor.<br>
* If you feel like in doubt, you might better have a look to the avalaible [screenshots](https://github.com/betamigo98/Choral-Annotations-For-Zotero/tree/main/Screenshots) or the [sample documents](https://github.com/betamigo98/Choral-Annotations-For-Zotero/tree/main/Choral%20Rendering%20-%20Free%20Samples) to get an idea of what the templates can do. There is also more previews on the [Readme page](https://github.com/betamigo98/Choral-Annotations-For-Zotero/blob/main/README.md) and in [section 3 from the template scripts document](https://github.com/betamigo98/Choral-Annotations-For-Zotero/blob/main/Template%20Scripts.md#3-other-templates---with-previews).
* Of course you could also try with the left-right format or [any other template](https://github.com/betamigo98/Choral-Annotations-For-Zotero/blob/main/Template%20Scripts.md#template-scripts). The rationale of this jump start was that the centered format is slighlty more visually striking than the others.<br>
