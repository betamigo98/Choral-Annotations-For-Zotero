# PolyDevice
This project will be describe soon

# Security concerns
## Templates
Undesired results, unsuccessful procedures or other misuses scenarios will not "break anything" in your Zotero database. Your previous annotation - exported or not yet exported will not change nor be affected. Your future annotation will be affected at the only moment of exporting highlights or standalone notes.
## Csl style
General documentations for csl style edition is already avalaible.
When installed, the title given to the csl style will mark it apart from the others ones, so installing styles from this repo will not overwright existing one in your style library.
## Additional Notes
The described security concern above are the result of my own opinion and, with all that has been said in the space of this repo, the use of the templates remains at your own risk.
