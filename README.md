# More About Choral Annotations
The more technical I could describe is that this is no more than a couple of html line in three fields in Zotero preference pane. There is also a very short amount of macro editing in the CSV Style editor.

The html lines are templates in the sense that they pre-format the annotations you made from Zotero reader pane. Last part of the formatting process pass through a word document and the use of CSV styles [link recent recensment des ces 14 normes non? ! #TODO ]

Is simulating a real conversation with author as they were right here in the very room we are as we read a poor idea or worst, a misleading idea that should not be developped?
Well, if it feels like this, no only it is "normal" but is actually a good sign for appreciating the value of the proposition.
The choral conception of having a concret discussion with real people in a stage has been and still is discussed in detail il the semiotic litterature (see Anscombre, 2009 for a general and presentation of core concept). As the first intuitive and naive sense of polyphonia as a couple of voices speaking refers to the certain view of the polyphonia concept, it engage with other theorical perspectives (See Anscombre en ibid. but also the other references in the Open Library associated to this repo).
It also join the trap of topology as it comes to tinking about space, as mentioned by Boris Beaude (2021) and its discussion involving the latin reference to the very word of "chora" - as a public space (see §64 en ibid.). Part of the decision making for the wording of choral annotation not only is to come closer to those reflexion, nor illustrate it, but make it felt by the annotator, with all the possible layer at stake (technology, dependecies, authorship, time and space) to engage our contemporary times with depth. Be from the field oh humanities, digital humanities, environmental humanities, or other approaches.

Annotations in medieval times had been reported as a central practice that could bring lights to understand contemporary challenges in various fields related to science, culture, institutions, democracy (see Clement & Fischer, 2021).
Annotations are also deeply studied as such, see for example a recent edition by the MIT press (Kalir &#38; Garcia, 2021).

Not so long time ago has been reported some of the struggles and enlightment of university students writing process. On the one hand there is a pledge to better dive in the field of literacy to make student quote better - more consistently with academics norms and expectations (REF - fr). On the other hands, some experiments with annotations had been regarded as very positive from didactic teacher and investigador in (#REF Manchester…). At the same time in the field of the digital humanities, there is still plenty of room for creativity and traditional knowledge fronteer remains challenges in stimulating ways. Being between art and science, programming and theatre, litterature and scenatic arts, this or the narrative of innovating projects, experimental methods ~proposition~ and breaking (or not) result from long duration and large scale experiment, bibliotherapy, the many functions of annotating (REFMIT) there must be a place for choral annotations in this world.

As it comes to pedagogy, the choral annotation process as proposed here could enter in the two categories of "Interaction" and "Reflexivité" in the typology proposed by a team of researcher in Switzerland, letting room for a wider reflexion on pedagogy design (Lanarès et al., 2023, pp. 104 y 109 en particular) 
Formatting is easthetics, and easthetics are in many view never disconnected from epistemelogy (and other vital processes), now it is not an excentric position that to sustain the idea that this brings some value to the process of knowledge production, tranfert, meaning, and feelings.

That being said, the preconcpetion of communication behind lays in wantt some authors in semantics have refered to an intuitive, if not naive, way of referring to the idea of polyphonie and communication (REF).

In any case, this project started from having fun, I hope you’ll have some too experimenting it for yourself!
